## What is it?
**FlowRunner** is a lightweight package to organize and represent Data Engineering/Science workflows. Its designed to be
integrated with any pre-existing framework like pandas or PySpark

## Main Features
- Easy BaseFlow to build all Flows
- Simple decorators to convert methods to Flow `step`
- Run flows with CLI or python class methods

## Installing FlowRunner
To install FlowRunner, following commands will work

Source code is hosted at https://github.com/prithvijitguha/FlowRunner

```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/prithvijitguha/FlowRunner@main
```

## Usage

Here is a quick example to run as is

```python
# example.py
from flowrunner import BaseFlow, step, start, end

class ExampleFlow(BaseFlow):
    @start
    @step(next=['method2', 'method3'])
    def method1(self):
        self.a = 1

    @step(next=['method4'])
    def method2(self):
        self.a += 1

    @step(next=['method4'])
    def method3(self):
        self.a += 2

    @end
    @step
    def method4(self):
        self.a += 3
        print("output of flow is:", self.a)
```

You can run the flow with the following command
```console
$ python -m flowrunner run example.py
output of flow is: 7
```
